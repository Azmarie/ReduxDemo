# Redux Demo with Github API

The project template built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) provides a simple way to start React projects with no build configuration needed.

Projects built with Create-React-App include support for ES6 syntax and some unofficial / not-yet-final forms of Javascript syntax, such as Class Properties and JSX. See the list of [language features and polyfills supported by Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#supported-language-features-and-polyfills) for more information.

## Available Scripts

The following commands are executable in project directory:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Reload after editing code.<br>
Lint of errors will be shown in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build in performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If not satisfied with the build tool or configuration choices, `eject` it at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from the project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts for you to tweak. At this point you are on your own.

However, using `eject` is not necessary. The curated feature set is suitable for any small-to-medium deployments, and do not feel obligated to use this feature. This tool is not useful if you cannot customize it when you are ready for it.
